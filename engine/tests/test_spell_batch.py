"""
The #431 Classic spell batch, on injected dice only.

Each spell gets its effect, its cost (heavy-target variants included), its
duration expiry, and its refresh behaviour pinned against the reference text
(docs/reference/the-fantasy-trip-wizard-spell-reference.txt, cited per test).
The dice stream a cast draws is unchanged from Gate 2: the 3-dice (4 against a
dodging/defending target) to-hit roll, then — for a missile spell that HIT —
one die per ST invested (see :meth:`engine.ruleset.Ruleset.resolve_spell`).
