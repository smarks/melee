"""
A combat figure: its attributes, gear, and mutable per-fight state (Section III).

A figure is created with Strength (ST) and Dexterity (DX), then equipped with
armor, an optional shield, and up to two weapons plus a dagger. ST governs how
many hits it can take and which weapons it can wield; DX governs how likely it is
to hit. Armor and a ready shield lower the *adjusted* DX (adjDX) used for to-hit
rolls and reduce the movement allowance.

This module owns the figure's identity, derived combat numbers, and the running
state of a fight (position, facing, posture, accumulated hits, per-turn flags).
The rules that read and mutate that state live in :mod:`engine.combat`,
:mod:`engine.movement`, and :mod:`engine.state`.

    A wizard is a figure with a raised IQ (``intelligence``), a chosen spell list,
    and optionally a staff. The 3-attribute wizard spread (ST + DX + IQ = 32, each
    >= 8) and the spell-list legality (size and tiers gated by IQ) are validated in
    :mod:`engine.chargen`; this constructor just assembles the figure, so a caller
    that has already validated (or an admin building outside the rules) is not
    re-checked here beyond the Figure's own ST/DX-positive guard.

    Args:
        strength: The injury AND spell-power pool (ST doubles as mana, p.3-4).
        dexterity: The casting to-hit attribute.
        intelligence: IQ -- gates which spells and how many the wizard may know.
        spells_known: Spell ids (see :mod:`engine.spells`); empty means an
            unarmed-of-magic figure, which then behaves exactly like a fighter.
        has_staff: Force-grant a staff without the spell (direct engine callers
            only). Normally derived: knowing the Staff spell ("staff" in
            ``spells_known``) is what grants a staff (p.19), so the editor's
            spell picker is the one way to gain or lose it.
