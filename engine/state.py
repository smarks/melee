"""
Game state and the turn engine (Section IV sequencing).

``GameState`` is the single source of truth for a fight: the arena, every
figure, the turn counter, and the dice. It exposes the action verbs a UI or a
test calls -- roll initiative, move a figure under a chosen option, queue and
resolve attacks in adjDX order, force a retreat, end the turn -- and each verb
enforces the relevant rules, raising :class:`IllegalAction` on a violation.

A turn runs:
  1. initiative -- each side rolls a die; the winner picks who moves first;
  2. movement -- each side, in order, picks one option per figure and moves;
  3. combat -- queued attacks resolve highest-adjDX first (Section VII);
  4. force retreats -- a figure that hit and was not hit may push its foe;
  5. cleanup / end -- knockdowns settle and injury flags roll forward.
