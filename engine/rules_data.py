"""
Literal rulebook tables for The Fantasy Trip: Melee (3rd ed.).

These are the printed Weapon Table (p.14), Armor and Shields tables (p.14), and
the figure-creation constants (Section III). Everything here is frozen data; the
mutable per-fight state lives on :class:`~engine.figure.Figure`.

Damage is written in the rulebook as ``Nd+M`` / ``Nd-M`` (roll N six-sided dice
and add the modifier). We model that as :class:`DamageDice(count, modifier)`.

Page references are to the SJGames PDF edition supplied with the project.
