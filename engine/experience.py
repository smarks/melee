"""
Section IX "Experience": awarding XP after a fight and trading it for attributes.

A figure that survives combat earns experience points (XP). How many depends on
the *type* of combat and whether the enemy was, on average, stronger or weaker in
total attributes (ST+DX). Accumulated XP can be traded in — 100 XP buys one point
of basic ST or DX — up to a lifetime cap of 8 added points (Section IX, p.22).

The rule text these constants encode (Section IX, p.22):

  * Combat to the Death — "50 experience points (XP) to each survivor, or 100 if
    the enemy averaged more than 3 superior in ST+DX." (Losers die: no XP.)
  * Arena Combat — "Winners get 30 XP; defeated survivors get 20 XP (unless they
    ran away unhurt, in which case they lose 10 XP). If one side averaged 3 or
    more weaker in total attributes, survivors on that side get 10 extra XP each."
  * Practice Combat — "Those still on their feet when one side is eliminated get
    10 XP each. Others get nothing but bruises."
  * Spending — "A figure with 100 XP may 'trade them in' for one additional point
    added to either basic ST or basic DX. Up to 8 attribute points may be added."

These are pure helpers over :class:`~engine.figure.Figure`; they read and mutate a
figure's XP/attribute state but own no game-loop logic (that wiring lives in the
board views).
