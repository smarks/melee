"""
Plain-language combat narration for the running log.

Turns an :class:`~engine.combat.AttackResult` into a readable sentence — "The
red Knight swings a Broadsword at the blue Knight, who dodges clear." — so a
player can follow a fight without decoding raw rolls. Pure string-building; it
reads an attack outcome and the figures, and changes no state.

It works for either rules profile: ``result.needed`` is the adjusted-DX target
under classic Melee or the Target Number under Tarmar. The threshold reads
naturally in both directions — classic Melee rolls 3d6 *under* the target
(``needed N or less``) while Tarmar rolls a d20 *over* it (``needed N or
more``) — keyed off ``result.roll_under``.
