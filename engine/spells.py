"""
The spell catalog (Classic *The Fantasy Trip: Wizard*, 3rd ed.).

A :class:`Spell` is the frozen data a cast reads -- its IQ tier (which gates
whether a wizard may know it), its ST cost, and the type-specific numbers a
missile, protection, buff, or debuff spell needs. The *resolution* of a cast
(the to-hit roll, the fizzle table, the ST drain) lives in
:mod:`engine.ruleset` / :mod:`engine.combat`, exactly as a weapon's data lives
here while its attack is resolved by the ruleset; this module is pure data,
mutating nothing.

Every number below is transcribed from the searchable reference booklet
``docs/reference/the-fantasy-trip-wizard-spell-reference.txt`` (the numeric Spell
Table) and, for the missile cap and casting mechanics,
``docs/reference/the-fantasy-trip-wizard-rules.txt``. The exact source line is
cited on each field so a value is auditable against the rulebook (#229/#270: no
fabricated numbers).

**Durations** (#431). The rulebook gives every non-instant spell one of two
duration models (rules lines 229-232):

* a **stated duration** -- "lasts a stated number of turns after casting. The
  turn such a spell is cast is always counted as the first turn." These carry
  :attr:`Spell.duration` and expire by turn count
  (:meth:`engine.state.GameState.end_turn`).
* a **continuing** spell -- "cost ST each turn after being cast until the
  wizard turns them off" (rules lines 166-167), renewed at the turn's Renew
  stage or it "ends immediately, before movement" (rules lines 229-231), and
  renewable only by its caster, so it also ends when "the wizard dies or goes
  unconscious" (rules lines 229-231, 803). The Renew stage (and its per-turn ST
  charge) is still DEFERRED: until it lands, a continuing spell is treated as
  renewed at no cost each turn -- the caster-felled bound is the expiry this
  batch implements for them.

**Refresh, not stack** (#419, rules lines 683-684): "Only one Blur, one Stone
Flesh, one Shock Shield, etc., can be cast on any given figure at a time. These
spells are not cumulative." A recast REPLACES the running casting -- except the
Slow/Speed pair, whose reference text overrides the duration half: "Slow spells
do not multiply, but do add... they keep him at half speed twice as long"
(spell-ref lines 22-24, 82-84) -- :attr:`Spell.durations_add`.

    """One castable spell's rules data (frozen; shared like a catalog weapon).

    Attributes:
        id: Stable machine identifier (``"magic_fist"``), used in ``spells_known``
            and ``active_spells`` and never shown to a player.
        name: Display name as printed in the Spell Table ("Magic Fist").
        type: One of :data:`MISSILE`, :data:`THROWN`, :data:`CREATION`,
            :data:`SPECIAL` -- the "(M)/(T)/(C)/(S)" tag.
        iq_tier: Minimum IQ to learn it (the IQ heading it sits under in the
            table). A wizard may know it only when ``intelligence >= iq_tier``.
        st_cost: ST paid to cast it (the minimum for a variable-ST spell).
        max_st: For a variable-ST spell, the catalog ceiling on ST invested in
            one cast (rules line 620: "maximum 3" for every missile spell); 0
            means no catalog ceiling (a variable-ST thrown spell like
            Clumsiness is bounded only by the caster's own ST pool).
        variable_st: True when the caster chooses the ST invested (all three
            missile spells, 1..3; Clumsiness, -2 DX per ST). False = the flat
            :attr:`st_cost` (or its heavy-target variant) exactly.
        damage_per_st: For a missile spell, the per-ST damage-die modifier
            (Magic Fist 1d-2 -> ``-2``; Fireball 1d-1 -> ``-1``; Lightning 1d
            -> ``0``); 0 otherwise. The "never less damage than the ST used"
            floor is applied by :func:`engine.combat.roll_missile_spell_damage`.
        stops: For a protection spell, hits stopped per attack (folded into
            ``Ruleset.absorbed``); 0 otherwise.
        continuing: True if the spell persists and must be re-energized each turn
            (the Renew stage -- still deferred; see the module docstring). Its
            per-turn upkeep is :attr:`renew_cost`. A continuing spell has no
            :attr:`duration`; it ends when its caster is felled.
        renew_cost: ST paid each turn a continuing spell is maintained (0 for a
            fire-and-forget spell). Recorded now; the Renew turn-stage that spends
            it is still deferred.
        trips_at: For a missile spell that also trips, the PRE-armour damage at
            which the target must save (3 dice vs ST or DX, whichever is higher)
            or fall down — Magic Fist trips at 6 (spell-ref lines 18-21, #421);
            0 for a spell with no trip effect.
        duration: Stated duration in turns ("Lasts 3 turns"); 0 for an instant
            effect or a continuing spell. Expiry ticks at end of turn, the cast
            turn counted as the first (rules lines 231-232).
        duration_heavy: Duration against a heavy target -- a figure whose BASIC
            ST is :attr:`heavy_st` or more (Clumsiness: "1 turn if victim's ST
            is 30 or more", spell-ref line 39). 0 = no heavy variant.
        st_cost_heavy: Flat cost against a heavy target (Drop Weapon: "2 ST if
            victim's basic ST is 20 or more"; Trip: "4 ST if target has 30 ST
            or over"). 0 = no heavy variant.
        heavy_st: The basic-ST threshold the heavy cost/duration variants key
            on; 0 = the spell has no heavy variant.
        durations_add: A recast ADDS its duration to the running casting instead
            of replacing it (Slow/Speed Movement: "Slow spells do not multiply,
            but do add", spell-ref lines 22-24, 82-84).
        targets_self: A buff/protection cast on the caster itself this batch
            (allies deferred, matching Stone Flesh's existing gate).
        exclusive_with: Spell ids this one cannot coexist with on a figure --
            landing it removes them (Stone Flesh is "not with Iron Flesh",
            spell-ref lines 204-206).
        dx_penalty_per_st: DX penalty on the SUBJECT per ST invested, negative
            (Clumsiness: "-2 for every ST in the spell", spell-ref lines 38-39,
            DX table lines 353-354); 0 otherwise.
        defense_dx_penalty: DX penalty on attacks/casts AGAINST the subject,
            negative (Blur: "Subtracts 4 from DX of all attacks/spells against
            subject" -> ``-4``); 0 otherwise.
